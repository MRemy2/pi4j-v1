## PROJECT OVERVIEW

  Starting with the Pi4J 1.4 builds, the Pi4J project is prioritizing focus 
  on providing Java programs access, control and communication with the core 
  I/O capabilities of the Raspberry Pi platform.  Earlier versions of Pi4J
  were perhaps too ambitious in scope and that led to significant project
  bloat to the point that the project was becoming unsustainable.  The goal
  moving forward is to limit scope to that of the raw I/O capabilities 
  of the Raspberry Pi platform and provide timely updates and releases for
  bug fixes and new RaspberryPi model introductions.  Reducing the scope of 
  the project should better serve the Java community for basic I/O access by
  reducing complexity.
  
  The following features have been removed from the Pi4J library:
  
  * **IO Expanders** -- IO expansion is still supported but concrete 
  implementations should be provided outside the core Pi4J core project such 
  that they can be maintained and extended independently.
   
  * **Other Platforms** -- Other platforms such as Odroid, BananaPi, NanoPi, 
  OrangePi, etc. have been removed and will no longer be supported.  The  
  challenge with supporting these additional platforms is that Pi4J depends on  
  the underlying WiringPi project and WiringPi ports for these other platforms 
  is not well supported by the various SoC vendors or community.  The various 
  WiringPi ports for these other platforms are also inconsistent causing 
  inconsistent features and functionality of Pi4J.  Additionally, regression
  testing of bug fixes and new features in Pi4J is compounded with each 
  additional supported platform.
  
  * **Components & Devices** -- Pi4J originally provided higher level 
  interfaces for components and devices that provided an abstraction
  layer between real world devices (things) and lower-level I/O interfaces.  
  While a noble goal, unfortunately this part of the project never received 
  the attention and time that it deserved and never gained much adoption
  by the community.  We are removing these to allow Pi4J to focus solely on
  the raw I/O supported by the Raspberry Pi platform.

## Building

To build locally without needing a Raspberry, use the Docker process:

```
docker pull pi4j/pi4j-builder:1.4
docker run --user "$(id -u):$(id -g)" --rm --volume $(pwd):/build pi4j/pi4j-builder:1.4
```
